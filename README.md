# 🛒 JGStore

**JGStore** is a lightweight and functional application manager designed specifically for **Windows 7** and older versions of Windows. Its goal is to simplify the process of downloading and installing software compatible with outdated hardware and operating systems, offering a modern but highly optimized solution for low-resource environments.
